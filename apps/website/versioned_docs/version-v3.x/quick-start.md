# Quick Start

## Requirements

You need the following to use MACI:

- Node.js: use a JS toolchain manager like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [`volta`](https://volta.sh/) to install Node.js. We recommend using Node 20 or above.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation): Fast, disk space efficient package manager.

## Installation

To install MACI you need to run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci.git && \
cd maci && \
pnpm install && \
pnpm run build
```

:::note
We suggest you use the latest released version. You can check all the releases [here](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/releases).
:::

#### Decide whether you need to compile new circuits or use the test ones

If you are going to be making any changes to the circom circuits, then you can follow the [compile circuits guide](./guides/compile-circuits.md) and skip the next section.

### Download the zero knowledge artifacts

MACI has two main zk-SNARK circuits, and each of them is parameterized. In order to prove and verify them we need to use the `.zkey` Artifacts. There should be one
`.zkey` file for each circuit and set of parameters.

Unless you wish to generate a fresh set of `.zkey` files, you should obtain
them from someone who has performed a multi-party trusted setup for said
circuits. For more details on which artifacts have undergone a trusted setup, please refer to the [Trusted Setup](/docs/security/trusted-setup) page.

:::important
Note the locations of the `.zkey` files cause you will need it when deploying contracts.
:::

#### Download test artifacts

For all but production use cases, we suggest using the test artifacts, with the latest dev updates you can do it by running:

```bash
pnpm download-zkeys:test
```

#### Download ceremony artifacts

For production you need to use the ceremony artifacts which have undergone a trusted setup, you can download them with the command:

```bash
pnpm download-zkeys:ceremony
```

:::info
Currently, the ceremony artifacts work with MACI version up to 2.x
:::

## Deploy Contracts

### Generate Coordinator Keys

In order to run MACI polls, a coordinator is required to publish their MACI public key. You will need to generate a MACI keypair, and treat the private key just as your ethereum private keys. Please store them in a safe place as you won't be able to finish a round if you lose access, or if compromised a bad actor could decrypt the vote and publish them online. You can generate a new key pair using maci-cli by running the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
pnpm run generateMaciKeyPair
```

### Set the .env

Head to the `packages/contracts` folder and copy the `.env.example` file.

```bash
cd packages/contracts && \
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure to include a mnemonic and RPC url (make sure to replace NETWORK with the network you want to use).

```js
MNEMONIC = "your_ethereum_secret_key";
NETWORK_RPC_URL = "the_eth_provider_url";
NETWORK_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "etherscan api key";
```

### Set the configuration file

In the folder and copy the config example and update the fields as necessary:

```bash
cd ./packages/contracts && \
cp deploy-config-example.json deploy-config.json

```

#### ConstantInitialVoiceCreditProxy

Specifies the number of credits allocated to each voter.

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **deploy** | Defines if the contract needs to be deployed.            |
| **amount** | Defines how many vote credits each participant will get. |

#### Policy

MACI uses a "policy" contract to configure and enforce the eligibility criteria of voters who can participate in MACI polls. In other words, it is a way to allowlist signups to the system to protect against sybil attacks. Please refer to the [policy page in the documentation](/docs/technical-references/smart-contracts/Policies) for more information on the supported Policies.

| **deploy** | Defines if the contract is going to be deployed. |

:::important
For testing we suggest using the **FreeForAlPolicy** as it allows anyone to signup on MACI.

| **voteOptions**             | Defines how many votes options are valid for this poll.           |

### Deploy MACI Contracts

To deploy the MACI contracts to a specific network you can append `:network` to the deployment commands, e.g. `pnpm deploy:sepolia` - please refer to the available networks on the package.json scripts section.

```bash
pnpm deploy:NETWORK
```

There are already some deployed contracts that could be reused, copy the `default-deployed-contracts.json` file if you need them to avoid deploying redundant contracts and save your gas fee.

```bash
cp default-deployed-contracts.json deployed-contracts.json
```

Delete any contract you want to redeploy and then run the following command to save gas:

```bash
pnpm deploy:NETWORK --incremental
```

### Deploy Poll

Before deploying a Poll, make sure you have set the coordinator MACI public key to which you own the private key. To deploy your first Poll you can run the following command:

```sh
pnpm deploy-poll:NETWORK
```

:::important
Starting another poll doesn't require deploying MACI contracts again, you can run `pnpm deploy-poll:NETWORK` command and then use the new poll-id.
:::

## Poll Finalization

As a coordinator, first you need to merge signups and messages (votes). This optimization is needed to reduce gas cost for voters. Then the coordinator generates proofs for the message processing, and tally calculations. This allows to publish the poll results on-chain and then everyone can verify the results when the poll is over. You run a merge with:

```bash
pnpm merge:[network] --poll [poll-id]
```

Then you need to generate the proofs for the message processing, and tally calculations. This allows to publish the poll results on-chain and then everyone can verify the results:

```bash
pnpm run prove:[network] --poll [poll-id] \
    --coordinator-private-key [coordinator-maci-private-key] \
    --tally-file ../results/tally.json \
    --output-dir ../results/proofs/ \
    --start-block [block-number]
    --blocks-per-batch [number-of-blocks]
```

:::important
You can reduce the time of the proving by including more blocks per batch, you can try with 500.
:::

#### Submit On-chain

Now it's time to submit the poll results on-chain so that everyone can verify the results:

```bash
pnpm submitOnChain:[network] --poll [poll-id] \
    --output-dir proofs/ \
    --tally-file proofs/tally.json
```

### Tally

Once the proofs are generated, and results tallied, the results (Tally) are written to a file. Let's take a look at one:

```json

  }
}
```

We observe an array named results, which holds the aggregated votes for each option. Each option corresponds to an index in the array. In the example above, the first option (index 0) received a total of 9 votes, while all other options received no votes

The `totalSpentVoiceCredits` object contains the total amount of voice credits spent in the poll. This is the sum of all voice credits spent by all voters, and in quadratic voting, is the sum of the squares of all votes.

The `perVoteOptionSpentVoiceCredits` will contain the amount of voice credits spent per vote option. In this case, the first option received 81 voice credits, and every other option received 0 voice credits. This is because there was only one valid vote casted, with a weight of 9. Given the quadratic voting formula, the total amount of voice credits spent is 81.
