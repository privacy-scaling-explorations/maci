There are two ways to run the coordinator service: building it from source or using Docker. Both methods require you to clone the MACI repository and move to the project root directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci
cd maci
```

You need to check the latest [README.md](https://github.com/privacy-ethereum/maci/tree/main/apps/coordinator) instructions in the coordinator service app for a detailed information about requirements and steps to install, build and run the service.
